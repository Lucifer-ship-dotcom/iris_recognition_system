# Iris Recognition System – Report

## 👁️ Introduction
This report describes the development of a complete Iris Recognition System that performs image preprocessing, iris segmentation, normalization, feature extraction, and matching using Python and OpenCV.

---

## 🔧 Methodology

### 1. Image Preprocessing
- Convert to grayscale
- Apply median blur
- Perform histogram equalization

### 2. Iris Segmentation
- Used Hough Circle Transform to detect:
  - **Pupil boundary** (inner circle)
  - **Limbus boundary** (outer circle)

### 3. Normalization
- Daugman's rubber sheet model inspired transformation
- Converted circular iris region to a fixed-size rectangular strip

### 4. Feature Extraction
- Applied Laplacian filter on normalized image
- Binarized the sign (positive/negative) of responses
- Flattened to form a feature vector

### 5. Feature Matching
- Used **Hamming Distance** for comparing feature vectors
- Lower distance indicates better match

## 📊 Evaluation

Used manually labeled true vs predicted identities on sample dataset.

| Metric     | Value     |
|------------|-----------|
| Accuracy   | 0.80      |
| Precision  | 0.83      |
| Recall     | 0.83      |
| F1 Score   | 0.80      |

## 📂 Dataset
- Used CASIA-Iris-Interval sample images (you may switch to full dataset for large-scale testing)
- Format: Grayscale frontal iris images

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-Image
- Scikit-Learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Challenges
- Handling occlusions from eyelids/eyelashes
- Variations in illumination
- Accurate circle detection in low-quality images

---

## 💡 Improvements (Future Work)
- Use deep learning (CNN) for segmentation
- Liveness detection to prevent spoofing
- Real-time webcam-based iris detection
- GUI for easy testing

---

## ✅ Conclusion
A modular, working iris recognition pipeline was successfully implemented. The system shows good accuracy and can be improved further with advanced techniques and datasets.
